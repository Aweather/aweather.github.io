What are hedge funds?
- Tries to deliver positive returns irrespective of market conditions.
- No need to be fully invested, while traditional funds needs to be fully invested.
- Fund managers are usually asked to eat your own cooking.
- Uses two techniques: leverage, and short selling.
- The fund manager charges management fee (fixed percentage) and performance fee (based on the gain).

Leverage
- A higher leverage does not neccessary mean higher risk. Global risk is a function of underlying risk and leverage.

Short selling
- Being wrong on short selling has a higher risk, since the higher the price becomes, the larger percentage the loss takes in the portfolio.

Long-short equity funds
- Long good positions and short bad positions.
- Return is the average of the increase of value in the long positions and the decrease of value in the short positions.
- Volatility is lower for long-short funds than a pure long or short position, and therefore sharpe ratio is higher.
