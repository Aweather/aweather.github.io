Efficient market hypothesis
- Weak efficiency: Price reflects public information about past prices
- Semi-strong efficiency: Above plus all relavant and publicly available information.
- Strong efficiency: Above plus private information.

The more efficient a market is, the less predictable it is. The market is probably at least weak and semi-strong efficient. To have strong efficiency, we need regulations.
