![Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate Efficient Frontier](/assets/img/investment-management/stock-bond-real-estate-efficient-frontier.png)
A few observations
- Real estate should not take more than 50% of the investment to be on the efficient frontier.
- Without real estate, the only way to be on the efficient frontier is 100% stocks.
- With real estate investment, depending on how much risk the investor can tolerate, the investor can purchase some bonds, or no bonds. In any case, bonds should not exceed 75/90 = 83% of the total portfolio in order for the portfolio to be on the efficient frontier.

Benefits
- International diversification
- Hedge against inflation
