Investor's goals and need
- Two views
  - Believes in market efficiency and perfect rationality of investors. Strategic asset allocation does not depend on wealth and age.
  - Our attitude towards risk is more complex and depends on multiple factors such as age, wealth, education, etc.
- Observations
  - People shfit out of risky assets when they retire. The older people get, the more risk averse people become.
  - Aversion to risk is inversely related to our wealth.

Strategic asset allocation
- The main assumption for periodically rebalancing is that return parameters change over time.
- Six steps: 1) Define investment horizon 2) Define risk appetite 3) Define investor's constraints 4) Select Optimization tool 5) Estimate return parameters 7) Rebalance portfolio weights over time (every 1 or 2 years)
- SAA is usually done over 3-20 asset classes. 
- Variance and covariance is easy to estimate, while mean is very difficult to estimate.
- SAA needs rebalancing after the asset classes experienced different levels of returns, regardless of our market views.
- Investor profile should be flexible enough.

Tactical asset allocation
- TAA is finding market opportunities within the range set in SAA.
- TAA involves making
  - Periodical tiles in the asset allocation, either across or within each asset.
  - Short to medium horizon decisions.
- Drivers: Market timing, valuation, business cycle, market trends, thematic investment.
- Market timing: to prevent losses in bear markets. Time to get back is challenging.
- Valuation: Identify over and undervalued sectors or regions and decrease or increase allocation to those assets **temporarily**. 
- P/E does not always work (such as in 2007).
- P/E minus growth can be used to compare assets.

Market timing key drivers
- Valuation
- Macroeconomic fundamentals
- Technical analysis

Valuation & Timing
- CAPE (Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings or PE10): earnings fluctuate around a rising long-term trend.
- Main argument against market timing: if you miss the top 40 days in a year, your return will be negative. This suggests that "You should not do it because it is difficult."
- If you are early to spot entrys and exits of recessions, it will make a big difference. So we pay our attentino on macroeconimic fundamentals.
- When bond yields are low, the P/E of stock is high (the equity market performs well).
- Switching from risky assets to risk free assets at the right time can give high rewards. 
- When consumer confidence year over year change falls below -20%, there is a recession. Consumer confidence can be found [here](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/cb-consumer-confidence-48).
