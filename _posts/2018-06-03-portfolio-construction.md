Portfolio Construction 
- Top-down: Macroeconimic driven methodology. Considers the factors in the following order: global factors, countries, sectors, stocks.
- Bottom-up: Valuation screening, research, technical analysis (right timing).

Top-Down portfolio construction
- When market trends sideways, stock-picking is better.
- When there is a dispersion across countries and sectors, top-down is better.
- So we need to combine them the two methods.

Comparison of the two approaches
- Top-down enables you to manage the risk of the portfolio, such as holding more cash or hedge market exposure.
- Bottom-up allows you to manage portfolio risk if you don't need to be fully invested or if you can do short selling.

Bottom-Up picking criteria
- Below average risk
- Attractive valuation
- Positive momentum

Investment styles: Value vs Growth
- Value stocks are cheap in terms of price to earnings, cash flows, dividends, book value.
- Growth stocks are more expensive in those metrics.

Why value normally outperform growth stocks?
- Market tends to overvalue growth stocks and undervalue value stocks.

Investment styles: Momentum vs Contrarian
- Momentum: Buys past winners.
- Contrarian: invest out of favor stocks, under valued, or reversing a downward trend. - Contrarian investors stablizes market prices and momentum investors exaberates prices.
- Institutional investors tend to be contrarian investors, and foreign investors tend to be momentum investors.
- Warren Buffet is a famous contrarian: Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.

Core & satellite
- Combines actively managed funds (satellite) with index funds (core). 
- Separates market-tracking and uncorrelated actively managed investments. This could boost risk-adjusted returns due to lower fees and higher diversification.
- Portable alpha is the return of an investment portfolio with zero market risk (beta).  We can use derivate products to hedge the market risk for the core. Hopefully it will have a 0 beta, and hopefully a positive alpha.
