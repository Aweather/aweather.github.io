Leverage
- A higher leverage does not neccessary mean higher risk. Global risk is a function of underlying risk and leverage.

Short selling
- Being wrong on short selling has a higher risk, since the higher price means it becomes a larger percentage of your portfolio.

Long-short equity funds
- Long good positions and short bad positions
- Return is average of the increase of value in long positions and decrease of value in short positions.
- Volatility is lower for long-short funds than investing purly in long or short positions, and therefore sharpe ratio is higher.
