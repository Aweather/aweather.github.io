Buying & selling
- We are tempted to buy because we highly value the company and share price has been performing well recently.
- The right question to ask for oneself of whether to sell is: "If I had X dollars, would I invest in the stock?""
- Should not look at the return you made when selling. 
- We have a bias of refraining from exiting loss-making investments.

Valuation
- Look at P/E ratio. Compare the P/E ratio with the history of the stock and the sector. 
- Also understand the company's strategy.

Investment profile
- Financial situation
- Risk tolerance
- Investment horizon

Decision process for investment
- Information gathering
- Information processing
- Decision making
