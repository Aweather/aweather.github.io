How our brains work?
- Brains are bad at absolute values. Perceptions are usually relative. Although perception can be conciously adjusted, it does not change the perception.
- Our brain always tries to fill in missing information with the most likely explanation with assumptions. When assumptions are wrong, errors arises in judgements.

Three basic steps in investing and how congitive bias affects the proceedure.
1. Definition of investment universe
  - Home bias: Over invest in security we believe we have more information about.
  - Recency Bias: Overweights recent information.
2. Construction of optimial investment strategy
  - Anchoring bias: When we are asked to estimate something, we tend to be influenced by other unrelated numbers we recently encountered.
  - Confirmation bias: We tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs and ignores anything that contradicts them.
  - Overconfident bias: Over our estimate actual performance, where we rank among peers, and being overly sure about beliefs. This will make us underestimate risk.
3. Adjustment and rebalancing overtime
  - Endownment effect (status quo effect): We value assets we own differently from assets we do not own. We regret more on passing up an opportunity not benefiting more from one asset than passing an opportunity that would have been just as profitable.
  - Disposition effect: Sell winning positions too early and hold onto losing positions for too long.

Strategies to reduce bias in investing
- Don't rely on readily available data, get out of comfort zone, and do extensive research when defining investment universe.
- Look for information that contradicts your forecast.
- Buy and sell according to original strategy that was designed for the goal.

Performance and methodology assessment biases
- Hindsight bias: Even if the results turned out to be expected, it is only one outcome among others.
- Bias blind spot: We might see other people's bias, but not your own.

Strategies to reduce biases for performance reviews
- Keep a log of trasactions, motives behind each transactions, and information set where you used to reach the decision. 
- Keep a log of assets that you evaluated but decided not to buy or sell.

Although being rational does not guarantee that returns are maximized, the stock market in the long term is tied to the fundamentals of the economy and being rational helps in ensuring investments are based on fundamentals.
