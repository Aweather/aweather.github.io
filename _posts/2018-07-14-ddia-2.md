## Introduction
- Data models deeply affects how we think about the problem.
- Data models are built by layering one on top of another. The key question is: "how is it represented in terms of the next-lower layer?" Each layer hides the complexity of the layers below by providing a clean model.
- Every data model embodies assumptions on how it is going to be used. The data model has a profound effect on what the software above can or cannot do.
- In this chapter, we will compare the relational model, the document model, and a few graph-based models. We will also look at and compare various query languages.

## Relational Model Versus Document Model
- The goal of the relational model is to hide implementation details behind a clean interface.
- SQL was rooted in relational databases for business data processing in the 1960s and 1970s, and was used for transaction procesing and batch processing.
- SQL was proposed in 1970 and is probably the best-known data model, where data is organized into **relations** (tables), which is an unordered collection of **tuples** (rows).
- There were also the network model and the hirarchical model in the 1970s and 1980s, but the relational model dominated them.
- Relational database management systems (RDBMSes) and SQL became the tool of choice around mid-1980s.
- Object databases came and went around the 1990s, and XML databases appeared in early 2000s. However, neither really overtook the relational model.
- The relational model turned out to generalize very well.

### NoSQL
- NoSQL was just a catchy hashtag on Twitter for a meetup. NoSQL is the latest attempt to overthrow the relational model's dominance.
- Driving forces for NoSQL
  - A need for better scalability (larger datasets, high write throughput)
  - Preference for free and open source software
  - Specialized query operations that are not supported by the relational model
  - The restrictiveness of the relational schemas.
- It's likely that relational databases will continue to be used along with many nonrelational databases.
